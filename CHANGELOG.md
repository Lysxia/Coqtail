# Change Log

## Unreleased [master]

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Use `+channel` feature (Vim >=8.0 only) to enable non-blocking communication
  with Coq.
- Use a synchronous fallback for Vim 7.4.
- `CoqInterrupt` command that forwards `SIGINT` to the Coq process.
- `CoqRestorePanel` command that re-opens the Goal and Info panels in their
  original positions.
- Changelog, begin using semantic (more or less) versioning.

### Removed
- Dependency on `vim` Python module.
- Dependency on [vimbufsync].
- `CoqMakeMatch` command.
  It wasn't well thought out and didn't seem very useful.
  Please [open an issue](https://github.com/whonore/Coqtail/issues) if you'd
  like it to be re-added.

### Fixed
- No longer crash if Goal or Info panels are closed.

## [pre-1.0]
